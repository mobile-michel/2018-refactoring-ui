- **sketch**: refers to a preliminary, rough drawing or illustration of a website's layout, interface, or specific elements. It's often created using pen and paper, digital drawing tools, or specialized wireframing software.
- **wireframe**: simplified representation of a website's structure, focusing on the layout and placement of elements without detailed design or content. It's a blueprint that helps designers visualize the overall framework of a webpage, including the arrangement of elements like headers, footers, navigation menus, content areas, and call-to-action buttons.
- **mockup**: highly detailed, visual representation of a website or web application. It's a more refined version of a wireframe, incorporating elements like color, typography, imagery, and interactive features. Mockups are designed to give stakeholders and clients a realistic preview of how the final product will look and function.
- **prototyping**: process of creating a preliminary version of a product, system, or service to test and refine its design before final development. In web design, prototyping involves creating interactive models of a website or application to visualize how it will look and function.
- **wireframing**: involves creating simplified representations of a website's structure and layout. Wireframes focus on the arrangement of elements, navigation, and overall user flow without going into the details of color, typography, or imagery.
