Control your hierarchy with font weight or color, not with font size.

Use 2-3 colors:
- dark color for primary content (article's headline),
- grey for secondary content (article's date),
- lighter grey (or lighter background color) for tertiary content (footer's copyright notice).

Use 2 font weights:
- normal (400-500) for most text,
- heavier (600-700) to emphasize text.
